👉 This **Frontend-Only Spec** is **independent** of backend—you just need to wire APIs later.
It gives you a **rich, non-conventional UI/UX** that feels like a mix of a **social app + scheduler + vault**.

Do you want me to now **design the complete UI flow (screens + navigation map)** so you’ll have a clear React/Next.js page structure before coding?
